Retrieve the login command to use to authenticate your Docker client to your registry.
Use the AWS CLI:

	$(aws ecr get-login --no-include-email --region <region>)
	
Build your Docker image using the following command. You can skip this step if your image is already built:

	docker build -t <name:tag> .
	
After the build completes, tag your image so you can push the image to this repository:
	
	docker tag <name:tag> <account-id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/<name:tag>
	
Run the following command to push this image to your newly created AWS repository:
	
	docker push <account-id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/<name:tag>
